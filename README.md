## Database Interaction
### **Bad**
```php
class ProductController extends Controller
{
    public function show()
    {
        $products = DB::table('products')->where('active', 1)->get();
        return view('products.index', ['products' => $products]);
    }
}
```
### **Good**
```php
use App\Models\Product;

class ProductController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $products = Product::active()->get();
        return view('products.index', compact('products'));
    }
}
```
The **Good** approach follows best practices by: 
- Using Eloquent ORM instead of raw queries, making the code more readable, maintainable, and reusable.
- It utilizes a query scope (`active()`) for filtering, improving reusability, and `compact()` for cleaner variable passing to the view.

### **Bad**
```php
class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        // Query the database directly in the controller
        $users = DB::table('users')->get();

        return view('users.index', compact('users'));
    }

    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        // No validation, direct database insertion
        DB::table('users')->insert([
            'name' => $request->input('name'),
            'email' => $request->input('email'),
            'password' => bcrypt($request->input('password')),
        ]);

        return redirect()->route('users.index');
    }
}
```
### **Good**
```php
class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        // Use Eloquent model to fetch users
        $users = User::all();

        return view('users.index', compact('users'));
    }

    public function store(UserRequest $request)
    {
        // Validation logic is handled through a custom Form Request class
        User::create([
            'name' => $request->name,
            'email' => $request->email,
            'password' => bcrypt($request->password),
        ]);

        return redirect()->route('users.index');
    }
}
```
The **Good** approach improves readability, maintainability, and security by: 
- Using Eloquent instead of raw queries.
- It leverages a Form Request (`UserRequest`) for validation, keeping the controller clean and ensuring data integrity.
- Using `User::create()` follows Laravel's mass assignment best practices, making the code more concise and easier to manage.

## Middleware
### **Bad**
```php
public function handle($request, Closure $next)
{
    if (Auth::user()->role !== 'admin') {
        return response('Unauthorized.', 403);
    }

    return $next($request);
}
```
### **Good**
```php
public function handle($request, Closure $next)
{
    if (!Auth::user() || !Auth::user()->hasRole('admin')) {
        abort(403, 'Unauthorized action.');
    }

    return $next($request);
}
```
The **Good** approach improves security and readability by: 
- Properly checking if the user is authenticated before accessing their role.
- It uses `abort(403)` for cleaner error handling and leverages a role-checking method (`hasRole()`), making the code more reusable and maintainable.

---
## Caching
### **Bad**
```php
$products = DB::table('products')->get();
Cache::put('products', $products, 3600);
```
### **Good**
```php
$products = Cache::remember('products', 3600, function () {
    return Product::all();
});
```
The **Good** approach improves performance and efficiency by: 
- Using `Cache::remember()`, which avoids unnecessary database queries.
- It only queries the database if the cache is empty, making the code more optimized, readable, and maintainable.

---
## Events
### **Bad**
```php
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $user = User::create($request->validated());
    Mail::to($user->email)->send(new WelcomeMail($user));
}
```
### **Good**
```php
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $user = User::create($request->validated());
    event(new UserRegistered($user));
}
```
Event Listener:
```php
public function handle(UserRegistered $event)
{
    Mail::to($event->user->email)->send(new WelcomeMail($event->user));
}
```
The **Good** approach follows the event-driven design pattern, improving scalability and maintainability yy:
- Dispatching a `UserRegistered` event, it decouples the email-sending logic from the controller, making it easier to manage and extend (e.g., logging, notifications).
- This keeps the controller clean and adheres to Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

---
## Logging
### **Bad**
```php
Log::info('Something went wrong: ' . $e->getMessage());
```
### **Good**
```php
Log::error('Exception encountered.', ['error' => $e->getMessage(), 'trace' => $e->getTraceAsString()]);
```
The **Good** approach improves error logging and debugging by: 
- Using `Log::error()` instead of `Log::info()`, ensuring proper log severity.
- It also logs structured data (`error` message and `trace`), making it easier to analyse issues and track errors efficiently.

---
## Commands
### **Bad**
```php
public function handle()
{
    DB::table('orders')->where('status', 'pending')->delete();
}
```
### **Good**
```php
public function handle()
{
    Order::pending()->delete();
}
```
The **Good** approach improves readability, maintainability, and reusability by:
- Using Eloquent instead of raw queries. It leverages a query scope (`pending()`) for filtering, making the code cleaner and reusable across the application.

---
## Notifications
### **Bad**
```php
Mail::to($user->email)->send(new ResetPasswordMail($token));
```
### **Good**
```php
$user->notify(new ResetPasswordNotification($token));
```
The **Good** approach improves flexibility and maintainability by:
- Using Laravel's notification system instead of directly sending an email.
- This allows sending password reset notifications via multiple channels (e.g., email, SMS) without modifying the core logic, making the code more scalable and reusable.

---
## API Responses
### **Bad**
```php
return response()->json(['data' => $data], 200);
```
### **Good**
```php
return response()->json([
    'status' => 'success',
    'data' => $data,
], 200);
```
The **Good** approach improves consistency and clarity in API responses by:
- Explicitly including a `status` field, making it easier for clients to handle responses.
- This follows best practices for structured API responses, improving readability and maintainability.

---
## Blade Templates
### **Bad**
```php
@if ($user->role == 'admin')
    <p>Welcome Admin</p>
@endif
```
### **Good**
```php
@can('viewAdminDashboard', $user)
    <p>Welcome Admin</p>
@endcan
```
The **Good** approach improves security and maintainability by:
Using Laravel's authorization policies (`@can`). Instead of directly checking the role, it leverages permission logic, making it more scalable, reusable, and secure by centralizing access control.

---
## Direct querying in Blade files
### **Bad**
```
<h1>Users</h1>
@foreach (User::all() as $user)
    <p>{{ $user->name }}</p>
@endforeach
```
### **Good** 
Controller
```php
public function index()
{
    $users = User::all();
    return view('users.index', compact('users'));
}
```
**Blade**
```php
<h1>Users</h1>
@foreach ($users as $user)
    <p>{{ $user->name }}</p>
@endforeach
```
The **Good** approach improves performance, readability, and maintainability by:
- Following the MVC pattern. Fetching data in the controller prevents query execution inside the Blade view, reducing N+1 query issues and keeping the view clean and focused on presentation.

---
## Using `echo` in Blade files
### **Bad**
```php
<p><?php echo $user->name; ?></p>
```
### **Good**
```php
<p>{{ $user->name }}</p>
```
### **Even better**
```php
<p>{{ $user->name ?? 'Guest' }}</p>
```
The **Good** approach improves readability and security by:
- Using Blade's `{{ }}` syntax, which automatically escapes output, preventing XSS attacks.

The **Even Better** approach adds a null coalescing fallback (`?? 'Guest'`)
- Ensuring a default value is displayed if `$user->name` is `null`, improving user experience and preventing errors.

---
## Eloquent Relationships
### **Bad**
```php
$comments = DB::table('comments')->where('post_id', $postId)->get();
```
### **Good**
```php
$comments = $post->comments;
```
The **Good** approach improves readability, maintainability, and performance by:
- Leveraging Eloquent relationships instead of raw queries.
- Using `$post->comments` utilizes the defined relationship in the model, making the code cleaner, reusable, and more efficient by reducing direct database queries.

---
## Testing
### **Bad**
```php
public function testExample()
{
    $this->get('/home')->assertStatus(200);
}
```
### **Good**
```php
public function testHomePageLoadsCorrectly()
{
    $this->get('/home')
        ->assertStatus(200)
        ->assertSee('Welcome')
        ->assertDontSee('Error');
}
```
The **Good** approach improves clarity, coverage, and maintainability in testing by:
- Using a descriptive test method name (`testHomePageLoadsCorrectly`) for better readability.
- Adding assertions (`assertSee`, `assertDontSee`) to check for specific content, ensuring the page loads correctly.
- Making tests more robust and meaningful, catching potential issues beyond just the status code.

---
## Direct SQL Queries in Controllers
### **Bad** 
```php
public function index()
{
    $users = DB::select('SELECT * FROM users');
    return response()->json($users);
}
```
### **Good**
```php
use App\Models\User;

public function index()
{
    $users = User::all();
    return response()->json($users);
}
```
The **Good** approach improves readability, maintainability, and security by using Eloquent (`User::all()`) instead of raw SQL queries. This ensures:
- Cleaner and more expressive code
- Built-in protection against SQL injection
- Easier integration with Eloquent features (e.g., scopes, relationships)
- Database abstraction, making it easier to switch databases if needed

---
## Database Querying
### **Bad**
```php
// Direct query execution without optimization
$users = DB::table('users')
    ->join('orders', 'users.id', '=', 'orders.user_id')
    ->where('orders.created_at', '>', now()->subMonth())
    ->select('users.name', 'orders.total')
    ->get();
```
### **Good**
```php
class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        // Use Eloquent relationships and eager loading
        $users = User::with('orders')->whereHas('orders', function($query) {
            $query->where('created_at', '>', now()->subMonth());
        })->get();

        return view('users.index', compact('users'));
    }
}
```
The **Good** approach improves performance, readability, and maintainability by:
- Using Eloquent relationships (`with('orders')`) instead of raw joins, making the query more expressive and easier to manage.
- Leveraging `whereHas()` to filter users efficiently based on their orders, reducing unnecessary data retrieval.
- Eager loading (`with()`) to prevent N+1 query issues, optimizing database performance.
- Keeping the controller clean and following Laravel best practices.

---
## Validation
### **Bad**
```php
public function store(Request $request)
{
    // No validation, using raw request data
    $user = new User;
    $user->name = $request->input('name');
    $user->email = $request->input('email');
    $user->password = bcrypt($request->input('password'));
    $user->save();
}
```
### **Good**
```php
class UserRequest extends FormRequest
{
    public function rules()
    {
        return [
            'name' => 'required|string|max:255',
            'email' => 'required|email|unique:users,email',
            'password' => 'required|string|min:8|confirmed',
        ];
    }
}
```
**Controller**
```php
public function store(UserRequest $request)
{
    $user = User::create($request->validated());
}
```
The **Good** approach improves security, readability, and maintainability by:
- Using a Form Request (`UserRequest`) to handle validation, keeping the controller clean and enforcing data integrity.
- Utilizing mass assignment (`User::create()`), making the code more concise and readable while adhering to Laravel's best practices.
- Ensuring better security by preventing unvalidated data from being stored, reducing the risk of injection attacks or invalid data.

---
## Security Concerns
### **Bad** 
```php
public function login(Request $request)
{
    $user = User::where('email', $request->email)->first();

    if ($user && Hash::check($request->password, $user->password)) {
        Auth::login($user);
        return redirect()->route('dashboard');
    }

    return back()->withErrors(['email' => 'Invalid credentials']);
}
```
### **Good**
```php
public function login(Request $request)
{
    $credentials = $request->only('email', 'password');

    if (Auth::attempt($credentials)) {
        return redirect()->route('dashboard');
    }

    return back()->withErrors(['email' => 'Invalid credentials']);
}
```
The **Good** approach improves security, readability, and maintainability by:
- Using `Auth::attempt($credentials)`, which automatically handles user retrieval and password verification, reducing manual checks.
- Ensuring cleaner and more concise code, making it easier to read and maintain.
- Relying on Laravel’s authentication system, which includes built-in security measures like throttling and hashing, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.

---
## Error Handling
### **Bad**
```php
public function show($id)
{
    $user = User::find($id);

    if (!$user) {
        return response('User not found', 404);
    }

    return view('users.show', compact('user'));
}
```
### **Good**
```php
public function show($id)
{
    $user = User::findOrFail($id);

    return view('users.show', compact('user'));
}
```
The **Good** approach improves readability, efficiency, and error handling by:
- Using `findOrFail($id)`, which automatically returns a 404 error response if the user is not found, eliminating the need for manual checks.
- Keeping the code clean and concise, making it easier to read and maintain.
- Leveraging Laravel’s built-in exception handling, which ensures a standardized error response across the application.

---
## File Uploads
### **Bad**
```php
public function upload(Request $request)
{
    $request->file('image')->move('uploads', 'image.jpg');
}
```
### **Good**
```php
public function upload(Request $request)
{
    $request->validate([
        'image' => 'required|image|mimes:jpeg,png,jpg,gif|max:2048',
    ]);

    $path = $request->file('image')->store('uploads', 'public');

    return response()->json(['path' => $path]);
}
```
The **Good** approach improves security, validation, and maintainability by:
- Validating the uploaded file to ensure it is an image with allowed formats and size limits, preventing security risks.
- Using `store()` instead of `move()`, which leverages Laravel's filesystem abstraction, ensuring better security and flexibility.
- Storing files in the configured storage disk (`public`), making it easier to manage and retrieve uploaded files.
- Returning a JSON response with the file path, making it suitable for APIs and frontend

---
## User model 
### **Full name**
### **Bad**
```php
public function getFullNameLong(): string
{
    return 'Mr. ' . $this->first_name . ' ' . $this->middle_name . ' ' . $this->last_name;
}
```
### **Good**
```php
public function getFullNameLong(): string
{
    return $this->title . ' ' . $this->first_name . ' ' . $this->middle_name . ' ' . $this->last_name;
}
```
### **Better**
```php
public function getFullNameLong(): string
{
    return $this->title . ' ' . ($this->first_name ?? '') . ' ' . ($this->middle_name ?? '') . ' ' . ($this->last_name ?? '');
}
```
The **Good** approach improves flexibility and maintainability by:
- Dynamically using the `title` property instead of hardcoding `'Mr.'`, making it adaptable for different titles.

The **Better** approach further enhances robustness by:
- Using the null coalescing operator (`?? ''`), preventing potential `null` values from causing unwanted gaps or errors in the output.
- This ensures a consistent and clean full name format regardless of missing values.

### **Short name**
### **Bad**
```php
public function getFullNameShort(): string
{
    return $this->first_name[0] . '. ' . $this->last_name;
}
```
### **Good**
```php
public function getFullNameShort(): string
{
    $firstNameInitial = !empty($this->first_name) ? $this->first_name[0] . '.' : '';
    return $firstNameInitial . ' ' . $this->last_name;
}
```
The **Good** approach improves robustness and prevents errors by:
- Handling cases where `first_name` might be empty or null, avoiding potential undefined index errors.
- Using a conditional check (`!empty($this->first_name)`) to ensure the first name exists before accessing its first character.
- Providing a cleaner and safer way to format the short name, preventing unexpected issues in edge cases.

---
## Hardcoding configuration values
### **Bad** 
```php
public function sendEmail()
{
    $to = 'example@example.com';
    $subject = 'Hello World';
    mail($to, $subject, 'This is a test email.');
}
```
### **Good**
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

public function sendEmail()
{
    Mail::to(config('mail.default_to_address'))->send(new App\Mail\WelcomeMail());
}
```
The **Good** approach improves security, maintainability, and flexibility by:
- Using Laravel’s `Mail` facade, which integrates with various mail drivers (SMTP, Mailgun, Postmark, etc.), making email handling more reliable and configurable.
- Avoiding hardcoded email addresses by using `config('mail.default_to_address')`, ensuring environment-based configuration.
- Sending a properly structured Mailable (`WelcomeMail`), making emails reusable, testable, and maintainable.

---
## Not using Route Model Binding
### **Bad**
```php
public function show($id)
{
    $user = User::find($id);
    if (!$user) {
        abort(404);
    }
    return view('user.show', compact('user'));
}
```
### **Good**
```php
public function show(User $user)
{
    return view('user.show', compact('user'));
}
```

The **Good** approach improves readability, efficiency, and error handling by:
- Using route model binding (`User $user`), which automatically retrieves the user by ID, eliminating the need for a manual query.
- Automatically returning a 404 response if the user is not found, simplifying error handling.
- Keeping the controller method cleaner and more concise, improving maintainability.

---
## Hardcoding Dependencies instead of using Dependency Injection
### **Bad**
```php
public function sendNotification()
{
    $mailer = new \App\Services\Mailer();
    $mailer->send('Hello World');
}
```
### **Good**
```php
use App\Services\Mailer;

public function sendNotification(Mailer $mailer)
{
    $mailer->send('Hello World');
}
```
The **Good** approach improves maintainability, testability, and dependency management by:
- Using dependency injection (`Mailer $mailer`) instead of manually instantiating the class, making the code more flexible and easier to test.
- Allowing Laravel's service container to handle dependencies, making it easier to swap implementations (e.g., using a mock for testing).
- Promoting cleaner and more reusable code by following the Dependency Injection (DI) principle.

---
## Hardcoding configurations
### **Bad**
```php
$apiKey = '12345'; // API key hardcoded
```
### **Good**
```php
$apiKey = config('services.api.key');
```
The **Good** approach improves security, maintainability, and flexibility by:
- Storing the API key in Laravel's configuration files (`config/services.php`), preventing hardcoded sensitive information.
- Allowing easy environment-based configuration by fetching the key from `.env`, making it adaptable for different environments (local, staging, production).
- Enhancing security by keeping sensitive data out of the codebase, reducing the risk of exposure in version control.

---
## Mass assignment without guarded fields
### **Bad**
```php
public function store(Request $request)
{
    User::create($request->all());
}
```
### **Good**
Inside `User` model
```php
protected $fillable = ['name', 'email', 'password'];
```
Inside the controller
```php
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $data = $request->only(['name', 'email', 'password']);
    $data['password'] = bcrypt(data['password']);

    User::create($data);
}
```
The **Good** approach improves security, data integrity, and maintainability by:
- Using `$fillable` in the model to prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities, ensuring only allowed fields are mass-assigned.
- Explicitly selecting input fields (`only(['name', 'email', 'password'])`), preventing unwanted or malicious data from being stored.
- Hashing passwords (`bcrypt($data['password'])`) before storing them, ensuring proper security practices.
- Making the code cleaner and more maintainable, following Laravel's best practices.

---
## Lack of pagination for large datasets
### **Bad**
```php
public function index()
{
    $users = User::all();
    return response()->json($users);
}
```
### **Good**
```php
public function index()
{
    $users = User::paginate(10);
    return response()->json($users);
}
```
The **Good** approach improves performance, scalability, and user experience by:
- Using pagination (`paginate(10)`) instead of retrieving all records at once, preventing potential performance issues with large datasets.
- Returning a structured response that includes pagination metadata (e.g., total pages, current page), making it easier for frontend applications to handle.
- Following best practices for API responses, ensuring efficient data retrieval without overwhelming the database or API consumers.

---
## Use config and language files, constants instead of text in the code
### **Bad**
```php
public function isNormal(): bool
{
    return $article->type === 'normal';
}

return back()->with('message', 'Your article has been added!');
```
### **Good**
```php
public function isNormal()
{
    return $article->type === Article::TYPE_NORMAL;
}

return back()->with('message', __('app.article_added'));
```

The **Good** approach improves maintainability, readability, and localization by:
- Using a constant (`Article::TYPE_NORMAL`) instead of a hardcoded string (`'normal'`), reducing errors and making the code more maintainable.
- Utilizing Laravel’s localization helper (`__('app.article_added')`), allowing the message to be easily translated into multiple languages.
- Following clean coding principles, making the code more structured and adaptable to future changes.

---
## Using Constants for Repeated Values
### **Bad**
```php
if ($user->type === 'admin') {
    // Perform action
}
```
### **Good**
```php
class User
{
    public const TYPE_ADMIN = 'admin';
    public const TYPE_CUSTOMER = 'customer';
}
```
Usage
```php
if ($user->type === User::TYPE_ADMIN) {
    // Perform action
}
```
The **Good** approach improves maintainability, readability, and reduces errors by:
- Defining constants (`User::TYPE_ADMIN`) instead of using hardcoded strings, making the code easier to update and less error-prone.
- Enhancing code clarity by centralizing user type definitions in the `User` model.
- Preventing typos and inconsistencies when checking user types throughout the application.
- Making it easier to refactor if the user type values need to change in the future.

---
## API Rate Limiting
### **Bad**
```php
Route::get('/api/resource', [ApiController::class, 'index']);
```
### **Good**
```php
Route::middleware('throttle:60,1')->get('/api/resource', [ApiController::class, 'index']);
```
The **Good** approach improves security, performance, and API reliability by:

- Adding rate limiting (`throttle:60,1`), which restricts the number of requests (60 per minute) to prevent abuse and protect server resources.
- Enhancing API security by reducing the risk of DDoS attacks or excessive requests from malicious users.
- Following best practices for API development, ensuring fair usage and better user experience.

---
## Form Input Sanitization
### **Bad**
```php
$input = $request->all();
```
### **Good**
```php
$input = $request->only(['name', 'email', 'password']);
```
The **Good** approach improves security, data integrity, and maintainability by:
- Using `only(['name', 'email', 'password'])` to explicitly specify which fields to retrieve, preventing mass assignment vulnerabilities.
- Avoiding unintended or malicious input from being processed if extra fields are sent in the request.
- Making the code more predictable and secure, following Laravel best practices for handling user input.

---
## Custom Helpers
### **Bad**
```php
function calculateAge($birthdate)
{
    return \Carbon\Carbon::parse($birthdate)->age;
}
```
### **Good**
Create a dedicated helper file:
```php
if (!function_exists('calculateAge')) {
    function calculateAge($birthdate)
    {
        return \Carbon\Carbon::parse($birthdate)->age;
    }
}
```
Register the helper in `composer.json`:
```php
"autoload": {
    "files": [
        "app/helpers.php"
    ]
}
```
The **Good** approach improves reusability, maintainability, and performance by:
- Defining the function in a helper file, making it globally accessible without needing to repeat the logic in multiple places.
- Using `function_exists()` to prevent redeclaration errors and avoid conflicts.
- Autoloading the helper via `composer.json`, ensuring it is available throughout the application without manual imports.
- Following best practices for reusable utility functions, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

---
## Avoid Duplicate Queries
### **Bad**
```php
foreach ($users as $user) {
    $profile = $user->profile; // Triggers N+1 query issue
}
```
### **Good**
```php
$users = User::with('profile')->get();
foreach ($users as $user) {
    $profile = $user->profile;
}
```
The **Good** approach improves performance and database efficiency by:
- Using Eager Loading (`with('profile')`) to retrieve related profiles in a single query, preventing the N+1 query problem.
- Reducing database load by fetching all necessary data at once, improving response time and scalability.
- Following Laravel best practices for optimizing queries, ensuring a more efficient and maintainable codebase.

---
## Testing Practices
### **Bad**
```php
public function testUserCanLogin()
{
    $response = $this->post('/login', ['email' => 'user@example.com', 'password' => 'password']);
    $response->assertStatus(200);
}
```
### **Good**
```php
public function testUserCanLogin()
{
    $response = $this->post('/login', ['email' => 'user@example.com', 'password' => 'password']);
    $response->assertStatus(200)
        ->assertJsonStructure(['token']);
}
```
The **Good** approach improves test accuracy, API validation, and reliability by:
- Checking the response structure with `assertJsonStructure(['token'])`, ensuring the login API returns a token (or expected data).
- Enhancing test coverage by verifying both the HTTP status and the response format, making the test more meaningful.
- Following best practices for API authentication testing, ensuring the expected output is correctly implemented.

---
## Service Container Binding
### **Bad**
```php
$userRepo = new EloquentUserRepository();
```
### **Good**
Bind the repository in a service provider
```php
$this->app->bind(UserRepository::class, EloquentUserRepository::class);
```
Usage:
```php
$userRepo = app(UserRepository::class);
```

The **Good** approach improves maintainability, testability, and flexibility by:
- Using Dependency Injection via Laravel’s Service Container, making the code loosely coupled and easier to swap implementations.
- Following the Repository Pattern, which separates data access logic from business logic, enhancing code organization.
- Simplifying unit testing by allowing mocking of `UserRepository`, making tests more isolated and reliable.
- Promoting scalability, as different repository implementations (e.g., `CacheUserRepository`) can be easily introduced without modifying dependent code.

---
## Repository Pattern
### **Bad**
```php
class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $users = User::all();
        return view('users.index', compact('users'));
    }
}
```
### **Good**
```php
interface UserRepository
{
    public function getAll();
}
```
Repository Implementation:
```php
class EloquentUserRepository implements UserRepository
{
    public function getAll()
    {
        return User::all();
    }
}
```
Controller Usage:
```php
class UserController extends Controller
{
    private UserRepository $userRepository;

    public function __construct(UserRepository $userRepository)
    {
        $this->userRepository = $userRepository;
    }

    public function index()
    {
        $users = $this->userRepository->getAll();
        return view('users.index', compact('users'));
    }
}
```
The **Good** approach improves code maintainability, flexibility, and testability by:
- Applying the Repository Pattern, which separates database logic from controllers, making code more modular.
- Using Dependency Injection, allowing different implementations (e.g., `CacheUserRepository`) without modifying controller logic.
- Enhancing testability, as the repository can be easily mocked for unit tests.
- Following SOLID principles, particularly Dependency Inversion (D in SOLID), by depending on an interface rather than a concrete class.

---
## Using Static Methods
### **Bad**
```php
class UserHelper
{
    public static function isAdmin($user)
    {
        return $user->role === 'admin';
    }
}
```
### **Good**
```php
class UserHelper
{
    public function isAdmin($user)
    {
        return $user->role === 'admin';
    }
}
```
Usage:
```php
$userHelper = new UserHelper();
$userHelper->isAdmin($user);
```
The **Good** approach improves testability, flexibility, and adherence to best practices by:
- Avoiding static methods, which make unit testing harder since they cannot be mocked.
- Allowing Dependency Injection, enabling the helper to be injected where needed instead of relying on direct static calls.
- Following Object-Oriented Principles, making the helper extensible and reusable in different contexts.
- Improving maintainability, as instance-based classes can be easily replaced or extended without modifying all static calls.

---
## Queue Jobs
### **Bad**
```php
public function sendNotification(Request $request)
{
    Mail::to($request->email)->send(new NotificationMail());
}
```
### **Good**
```php
NotificationJob::dispatch($request->email);
```
Job Implementation:
```php
class NotificationJob implements ShouldQueue
{
    public function __construct(public string $email) {}

    public function handle()
    {
        Mail::to($this->email)->send(new NotificationMail());
    }
}
```
The **Good** approach improves performance and scalability by:
- Using a Queue: Offloading email sending to a background job prevents request delays.
- Enhancing User Experience: The user does not have to wait for the email to be sent before getting a response.
- Better Error Handling & Retries: Jobs can be retried automatically if they fail.
- Improving Maintainability: Separating concerns makes the code more modular and testable.

---
## Centralised Business Logic
### **Bad**
```php
public function calculateDiscount($price, $discountPercentage)
{
    return $price - ($price * ($discountPercentage / 100));
}
```
### **Good**
```php
class DiscountService
{
    public function calculate($price, $discountPercentage)
    {
        return $price - ($price * ($discountPercentage / 100));
    }
}
```
The **Good** approach improves separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability by:
- Encapsulating the logic in a service class: This makes the discount calculation reusable across the application, making it easier to manage changes.
- Following Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): The `DiscountService` has a single responsibility—handling the discount calculation.
- Enhancing testability: The service can be mocked or tested independently, making unit tests cleaner and more focused.
- Improving maintainability: The calculation logic is centralized in one place, so future updates or changes to the discount logic are easier to implement without modifying multiple parts of the codebase.

---
## Use Proper Exception Handling
### **Bad**
```php
public function show($id)
{
    $user = User::find($id);
    
    if (!$user) {
        return response()->json(['error' => 'User not found'], 404);
    }
    
    return response()->json($user);
}

```
### **Good**
```php
public function show($id)
{
    $user = User::findOrFail($id);
    return response()->json($user);
}

```
The **Good** approach improves readability, simplicity, and error handling by:
- Using `findOrFail`: This method automatically throws a `ModelNotFoundException` if the user is not found, simplifying the code and removing the need for manual error handling.
- Reducing boilerplate: No need to manually check if the user exists and return a custom error message; `findOrFail` handles this efficiently.
- Automatic Exception Handling: The `findOrFail` method triggers Laravel's built-in exception handler, which will return a proper 404 response.
- Improving consistency: The use of `findOrFail` aligns with Laravel's conventions, ensuring the code is consistent with the framework's error handling approach.

---

## Route Definitions
### **Bad**
```php
Route::get('/products', 'ProductController@index');
Route::post('/products', 'ProductController@store');
Route::get('/products/{id}', 'ProductController@show');
```

### **Good**
```php
use App\Http\Controllers\ProductController;

Route::resource('products', ProductController::class);
```

The **Good** approach:
- Uses `Route::resource()` for cleaner, RESTful route definitions.
- Ensures consistency across controllers and avoids repetitive code.

--- 
## Route Model Binding
### **Bad**
```php
public function show($id)
{
    $user = User::findOrFail($id);
    return view('users.show', compact('user'));
}
```

### **Good**
```php
public function show(User $user)
{
    return view('users.show', compact('user'));
}
```
The **Good** approach:
- Uses Laravel’s implicit route model binding.
- Reduces boilerplate code and increases readability.

  - Single `AppServiceProvider.php` instead of multiple providers.
  - Built-in WebSocket server (Reverb).
  - Simpler database defaults (SQLite for sessions, cache, and queues).
  - Performance optimizations like eager loading limits.
- What is health routing in Laravel 11?
  - Laravel 11 introduces a built-in `/up` endpoint that returns a `200 OK` response if the application is running. This helps with uptime monitoring in production environments.
    `GET /up`
    ```json
    {
        "status": "ok"
    }
    ```
